# Gitlet: Version-Control System
class: Data Structures\
project spec link: [Gitlet](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa17/materials/proj/proj3/index.html)

## Required Software
- MacOS
- Terminal
  - `make` command in xcode tools: type `xcode-select --install` in Terminal if `command -v make` returns nothing
- Java 8+ [Download](https://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp)

## Download Instruction
You can `clone` or download(zip) project code onto your desktop. Project will be saved in `version-control` directory.
If project directory is on your desktop, it will look like:
```
Desktop/
  :
  └── version-control/
        ├── gitlet/
        └── glet
```

## Usage
**NOTE: This version control system can ONLY track *.txt* files!**\
**It is highly recommended that you place your *.txt* files within `version-control/` directory**\
**Since gitlet only sees *one* directory above itself, if you are taking `gitlet/` outside of `version-control/`, make sure to take `glet` executable along with it (unless you are familiar with how to run the code)**
